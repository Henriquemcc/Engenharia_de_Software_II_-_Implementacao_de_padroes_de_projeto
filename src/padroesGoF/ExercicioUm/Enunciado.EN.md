# Exercise 1
Write a program (in Java or C#) that counts up to 10 and send the numbers for a logging tool. This logging tool must be constructed by a factory. Use Factory Method to allow the choice between two types of log: in a file ( log.txt ) or directly on the console/screen. The choice should be by a parameter passed to the program ("arquivo" -> file or "console").
